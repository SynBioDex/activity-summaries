# SynBioDex Activity Summaries

This repository creates summaries of recent activity on the specification (rather than software) repos within the SynBioDex organization.
This repo is based on the [nedbat/dinghy_sample](https://github.com/nedbat/dinghy_sample) repo, and uses GitHub Actions to generate a summary using [dinghy](https://pypi.org/project/dinghy/) and publish this to GitHub Pages.

The summary is accessible here: https://synbiodex.github.io/activity-summaries/
